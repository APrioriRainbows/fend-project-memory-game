# Memory Game Project

## About

A memory game where you flip two cards at a time and try to match all cards on the board. Cards are randomly shuffled at the beginning of the game and created in the HTML. Project is in pure JS since I wanted to avoid using jQuery, and utilizes CSS3 animations when cards do not match. Starter code included HTML, CSS (minus animations), but all JS, except where attributed, was written for the project.
