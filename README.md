# Memory Game Project

## About

A memory game where you flip two cards at a time and try to match all cards on the board. Cards are randomly shuffled at the beginning of the game and created in the HTML. Project is in pure JS since I wanted to avoid using jQuery, and utilizes CSS3 animations when cards do not match. Starter code included HTML, CSS (minus animations), but all JS, except where attributed, was written for the project.

You can view a live demo [here](http://apriorirainbows.com/public/fend-project-memory-game/).

## How to Play
*Click any card on the board to flip it over
*The timer will start once you flip your first card
*Choose any other card to flip it over
*If cards match, they will turn green
*If cards do not match, they will turn red and automatically flip back over
*You win the game by matching all 8 pairs of cards
*If you wish to restart the board in the middle of game play you may click the refresh button next to the timer
